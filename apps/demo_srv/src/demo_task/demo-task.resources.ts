   * 
   * Format Options:
   * 1. Array format (legacy): [feature1, feature2] - All features default to READ-ONLY
   * 2. Object format (recommended): { write: [...], read: [...] } - Granular control
   * 
   * Permission Logic:
   * - WRITE features: Can perform both READ and WRITE operations (full access)
   * - READ features: Can only perform READ operations (query-only access)
   * - Entity matching: Entities must end with "_FEATURE_NAME" to be accessible
   * 
   * Security Rules:
   * - Write operations (save, insert, update, delete) require WRITE permission
   * - Read operations (find, findOne, etc.) require READ or WRITE permission
   * - Command datasource ($) operations require WRITE permission
   * - Query datasource operations require READ or WRITE permission

   * 
   * Critical security setting that controls access to advanced database features.
   * When disabled, provides maximum security by blocking all direct SQL access.
   * 
   * When TRUE (enabled):
   * - ‚úÖ repo.raw('SELECT * FROM table') - Custom SQL queries
   * - ‚úÖ repo.queryBuilder('alias') - TypeORM query builder
   * - ‚úÖ repo.createQueryBuilder() - Direct query builder access
   * - ‚úÖ repo.manager access - Entity manager operations
   * - ‚úÖ repo.transaction() - Transaction handling
   * - ‚úÖ repo.dataSource access - DataSource operations
   * 
   * When FALSE (disabled - RECOMMENDED for production):
   * - ‚ùå All raw SQL blocked - Forces use of repository methods
   * - ‚ùå Query builder blocked - Prevents complex query injection
   * - ‚ùå Manager access blocked - No bypass of repository security
   * - ‚ùå Transaction access blocked - No direct transaction SQL
   * - ‚úÖ Standard repository methods still work (find, save, etc.)

   * Security Implications:
   * - FALSE: Maximum security, CQRS enforcement, audit trail
   * - TRUE: Advanced features, custom queries, potential security risks
   *

   * - Production: false (for security)
